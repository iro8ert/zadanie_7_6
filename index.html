		<h1>Waiting for love</h1>
		<h2>Avicii</h2>
		<div class="song"><p>Monday left me broken
		Tuesday I was through with hoping
		Wednesday my empty arms were open
		Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
		Thank the stars it's Friday
		I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
		Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
		I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
		To come around</p>
